Describe the opening of the game. This should include what choices are available to the user at the start of the game (e.g., the "character creation" phase) and what backstory or setup is presented. Also mention how the user choices at this point influence the gameplay later.
At the beginning during character creation, the user may name their character and chose an object to start the game with – either a light or a weapon. The game takes place in darkness, so the light will allow them to run (rather than walk) and a weapon will allow them to fight. There are several goals to pass by, and in some a light will be more helpful and in others a weapon is better to have.
For example, at one point the character will have to answer a riddle to get by a sphinx. If they answer wrongly, the sphinx will attack. The character cannot run fast enough to get away, but the character can fight. Therefore, it’s game over if they answer the riddle wrong and only have a light. Gameplay can continue if they answer the question wrong but are able to fight back.
At another point, a creature will approach from the darkness. The light will allow the character to run, but they will not be able to fight it. The weapon will be useless, but the player can hide because they are not casting light.
List the entities in the game. These are the people, monsters, objects, etc. that appear in the game. Be sure to mention the locations in which these entities are found, and perhaps some additional information regarding how these entities relate to the story and gameplay.
Creatures
Aos Sí – a spirit who appears just after the game begins to explain the purpose of the game. “You will not be able to exit the forest without the help of a map.”
The Sphinx – a creature who asks a riddle. Answer it wrong and she will attack you. Should that happen, with a sword you may fight the sphinx. With a light, there is no protection. She will catch you if you try to run. You will find her near the beginning of the game.
Dark Creature – you’re not sure what this creature is. It is fast and you can barely see it. With a light you can run. With a weapon, you may try to attack it (you will die.), or you may successfully hide because you are not casting light. You will run into this creature with a wrong turn.
Objects
Weapon or Light – Your starting point and with the right commands, both are helpful. You cannot run with a weapon and cannot hide or fight with a light.
Shovel – You need this to get the map to exit the forest. It is found at a dead end. Player will have to turn around to finish the game.
